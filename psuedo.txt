## Big Picture
----------------------
The application will require multiple aspects for front end and back end ties.
The application is designed to match users to one another based on compatibility that is calculated based on answers to 10 questions
A user input with name / picture (link) must be added, in addition to capturing score for questions as array
This array will hold answers that will be compared against one another to calcuate total difference, which will translate into how compatible one user is with another
